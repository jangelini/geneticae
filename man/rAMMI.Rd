the analysis can be included.}

enable fitting of labels. Defaults to 1.2.}

\item{limits}{logical. If `TRUE` axes are automatically rescaled. Defaults to
`TRUE`.}

origin are drawn. Defaults to `TRUE`.}

A biplot of class  \code{ggplot}

\description{
Produces classical or robust AMMI biplot as an object of class 'ggplot', with
options for customization.
}
\details{
To overcome the problem of data contamination with outlying observations,
Rodrigues, Monteiro and Lourenco (2015) propose a robust AMMI model based on
the M-Huber estimator and in robusts SVD/PCA procedures. Several SVD/PC
methods were considered, briefly described below, thus conveying a total of
five robust AMMI candidate models:
\itemize{
\item R-AMMI: uses the L1 norm instead of the more usual least squares L2
norm, to compute a robust approximation to the SVD of a rectangular matrix.
\item H-AMMI: Combines projection-pursuit and robust covariance estimation
techniques to compute the robust loadings. It is most adequate for
high-dimensional data.
\item G-AMMI: Uses projection-pursuit to compute PCA estimators. The
optimization is done via the grid search algorithm in the plane instead of the
p-dimensional space.
\item L-AMMI: The idea behind this approach is to perform  classical PCA on
the data but projected onto a unit sphere. When the data are elliptically
distributed the estimates of the eigenvectors are consistent
\item PP-AMMI: Uses projection-pursuit calculating the robust eigenvalues and
eigenvectors without going through robust covariance estimation. The principal
components can be sequentially computed and thus this method is very appealing
when few genotypes are evaluated under a wide range of environmental and/or
experimental conditions.
