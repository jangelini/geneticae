Understanding the relationship between crops performance and environment is a key problem for plant breeders and geneticists. In advanced stages of breeding programs, where few genotypes are evaluated through environments, multi-environmental trials (MET) is one of the most common experiments. They are conducted by testing a number of genotypes across multiple environments, allowing the identification of superior genotypes. Crop performance, is a function of genotype (G), environment (E) and genotype x environment interaction (GEI). METs are essential due to the presence of GEI which generates differential genotypic responses across environments (Crossa et al., 1990; Cruz Medina, 1992; Kang and Magari, 1996). This is a particular problem for plant breeders (Giauffret et al., 2000), therefore appropriate statistical methods should be used  to obtain an adequate GEI analysis.

geneticae package provides tools to analize data from advanced stages of
breeding programs, where few genotypes are evaluated across environments. The AMMI and SREG model, and the biplots that are obtained from them are the main functions included in the package. In addition to the classic version of the AMMI model, alternatives are included that allow overcoming its fragility in the presence of atypical observations. Finally, since the mentioned models require complete data, imputation techniques are included.
Unlike the existing functions that allow to fit these models, the package is more flexible in the format allowed for the input data set. Furthermore, the biplots created are ggplot objects, which means that after creating a graph, it can be further customized using several options of ggplot2 package.


## Getting Started

If you are just getting started with geneticae we recommend starting with the tutorial [_vignettes_](file:///F:/Especializacion%20en%20bioinformatica/Para%20proyecto%20final/Geneticae%20Package/geneticae/docs/articles/vignettes.html), and the examples throughout the package [_documentation_](file:///F:/Especializacion%20en%20bioinformatica/Para%20proyecto%20final/Geneticae%20Package/geneticae/docs/reference/index.html).

## Installation

You can install the released version of geneticae from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` {r, eval=F, tidy=TRUE}
install.packages("geneticae")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval=F, tidy=TRUE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jangelini/geneticae")
```
## Example

Some quick examples obtained from the geneticae package.

```{r, tidy=TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.align='center'}
library(geneticae)

data(yan.winterwheat)
GGE1 <- GGEmodel(yan.winterwheat)
GGEPlot(GGE1, sizeGen = 5, sizeEnv = 5, footnote=FALSE, title=FALSE)
```
