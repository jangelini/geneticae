Understanding the relationship between crops performance and environment is a key problem for plant breeders and geneticists. In advanced stages of breeding programs, where few genotypes are evaluated, multi-environmental trials (MET) is one of the most common experiments. They are conducted by testing a number of genotypes across multiple environments, allowing the identification of superior genotypes. Crop performance, the observed phenotype, is a function of genotype (G), environment (E) and genotype x environment interaction (GEI). METs are essential due to the presence of GEI which generates differential genotypic responses in the different environments evaluated (Crossa et al., 1990; Cruz Medina, 1992; Kang and Magari, 1996). This is a particular problem for plant breeders (Giauffret et al., 2000), therefore appropriate statistical methods should be used  to obtain an adequate GEI analysis.

geneticae package provides tools to analize data from advanced stages of
breeding programs, where few genotypes are evaluated. Among the functions available in the package are the AMMI model and the SREG model, and the biplots that are obtained from them. In addition, functions are included that allow to overcome the fragility of the methods between atypical observations, robust AMMI and imputation techniques since the methods do not work in the presence of atypical observations.
Unlike the other existing functions that allow adjusting these models, it is less restrictive in terms of the input data set. Also, the biplots created by the package are ggplot objects, which means that after a plot is created it can be further customized using various functions from the ggplot2 package.



## Getting Started

If you are just getting started with geneticae we recommend starting with the tutorial [_vignettes_](file:///F:/Especializacion%20en%20bioinformatica/Para%20proyecto%20final/Geneticae%20Package/geneticae/docs/articles/vignettes.html), and the examples throughout the package [_documentation_](file:///F:/Especializacion%20en%20bioinformatica/Para%20proyecto%20final/Geneticae%20Package/geneticae/docs/reference/index.html).

## Installation

You can install the released version of geneticae from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` {r, eval=F, tidy=TRUE}
install.packages("geneticae")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval=F, tidy=TRUE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jangelini/geneticae")
```
## Example

Some quick examples obtained from the geneticae package.

```{r, tidy=TRUE}
library(geneticae)

data(yan.winterwheat)
GGE1 <- GGEmodel(yan.winterwheat, centering = "tester")
GGEPlot(GGE1)
```
