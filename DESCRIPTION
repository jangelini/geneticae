Description: Data from multi environment agronomic trials, which are often 
  carried out by plant breeders, can be analyzed with the tools offered by this
  package such as the 'AMMI' model (Additive Main effects and Multiplicative 
  Interaction model) and the 'SREG' model (Site Regression model). Since these 
  methods present a poor performance under the presence of outliers and missing 
  values, this package includes robust versions of the 'AMMI' and 'SREG' 
  models, and also imputation techniques specifically developed for this kind 
  of data.
